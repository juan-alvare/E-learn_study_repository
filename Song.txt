It's warm here but the streets are anxious for our footprints
Stardust on our boots
Cozy armchair with a checkered blanket
But the trigger is being pulled off in time
Sunny day in blazing dreams

The blood type is on my sleeve
My number on my sleeve
Wish me good lock in the battle
Wish me not to remain here in this grass
I can pay but I do not want victory at any price
I do not want to put my foot on somebody's chest
I'd like to be with you, just stay with you
But the star high in the sky calls me: go!
